# Unhandled Database Error in Express.js Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js applications: insufficient error handling within route handlers.  The `bug.js` file showcases a route that fetches user data from a database but lacks proper error handling. This can lead to application crashes or unexpected responses to clients.  The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with robust error handling.

## How to reproduce the bug:

1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Run `node bug.js`.
3.  Make a request to `/users/:id` with an invalid `id`.  Observe the error in the console and the response to the client (likely a 500 error).

## Solution:

The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to correctly handle database errors.  Always anticipate potential errors (like database connection failures or invalid input) and provide graceful handling to prevent application crashes and return meaningful error messages to clients.
